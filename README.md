# AirAhead
An AQI prediction model that is trained on AQI and weather data from previous years and predicts aqi hotspots in the future

We are building a machine learning-based forecasting engine that predicts local Air Quality Index for the next 72 hours. Unlike traditional weather apps our program would aim to find a correlation between climate factors (wind, humidity, temperature) and pollutant concentrations in air. We aim to provide insights for sensitive groups and city planners to mitigate health risks before pollution spikes occur.
